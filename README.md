# DIDComm-V2
Implementation of DIDComm V2 protocols

## Background

As of version 1.3.0, the pico engine supports DIDComm V2 messages for every hosted pico.

The [Trust Ping Protocol 2.0](https://didcomm.org/trust-ping/2.0/) is the only built-in protocol.

The `krl` folder herein contains implementations of additional protocols.
